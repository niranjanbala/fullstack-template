## Core Philosophy

### Problem-Solving First
- **Start with the problem**: Every technical decision should solve a real problem, not just implement the latest technology
- **10x better solutions**: Focus on solutions that provide significant improvement over existing approaches
- **Persona-driven development**: Build for specific user personas with clear use cases
- **Deep-rooted philosophy**: Technical choices should align with overall product philosophy and mission

### Simplicity & Pragmatism
- **Complexity budget**: Every added complexity must justify its value
- **Progressive enhancement**: Start simple, add complexity only when needed
- **Maintainability over cleverness**: Choose readable, maintainable solutions over clever ones
- **Documentation-driven**: If it's not documented, it doesn't exist

### Production-Ready by Default
- **Build for production from day one**: Development practices should mirror production requirements
- **Observability-first**: Monitoring, logging, and alerting should be built in, not bolted on
- **Security by design**: Security considerations should be embedded in every decision
- **Performance as a feature**: Performance should be considered a core feature, not an afterthought

## Technology Stack Choices

- **Short iterations**: 1-2 week sprints for rapid feedback
- **Clear objectives**: Each sprint has specific, measurable goals
- **Retrospectives**: Regular reflection and process improvement

**Continuous Integration/Deployment**
- **Automated testing**: All tests run automatically on every commit
- **Automated deployment**: Staging deployments on every merge
- **Feature flags**: Gradual rollouts and easy rollbacks

## Architectural Principles

### Microservices-Ready Monolith

### API-First Design
**RESTful APIs**
- **Consistent patterns**: Standardized endpoints, HTTP methods, and status codes
- **Comprehensive documentation**: OpenAPI/Swagger documentation for all endpoints
- **Versioning strategy**: Clear versioning for backward compatibility

**Input Validation & Security**
- **Strict validation**: Validate all inputs at API boundaries
- **Rate limiting**: Protect against abuse and ensure fair usage
