## Contributing Guidelines

### Documentation Standards

1. **Clear and Actionable**: Every guide should be immediately useful
2. **Real-World Examples**: Include practical code examples and implementations
3. **Consistent Structure**: Follow the established documentation format
4. **Up-to-Date**: Ensure information reflects current best practices

### Writing Style

- **Use Active Voice**: "Deploy the application" not "The application should be deployed"
- **Include Examples**: Show, don't just tell
- **Be Specific**: Provide exact commands, file paths, and configurations
- **Consider Your Audience**: Write for developers with varying experience levels

### File Organization

- **Use Descriptive Names**: `api-documentation-standards.md` not `api.md`
- **Follow Category Structure**: Place files in appropriate category folders
- **Cross-Reference**: Link to related sections and external resources
- **Update Indexes**: Keep README files updated with new content

## Maintenance Commands

### Check Documentation Health

```bash
# Run comprehensive health check
make check-docs

# Check for broken internal links
make check-links

# Validate markdown files
make validate

# Check spelling (if aspell is installed)
make spell-check
```

### Documentation Statistics

```bash
# Get word count
make word-count

# View documentation status
make status
```

### Development Tools

```bash
# Serve documentation locally
make serve
# Access at http://localhost:8080

# Clean up temporary files
make clean
```
