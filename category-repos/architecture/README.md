# Architecture Guides

**Part of the [Comprehensive Documentation Framework](https://github.com/niranjanbala/fullstack-template)**

A comprehensive collection of software architecture guides covering modern architectural patterns, design principles, and system design strategies.

## What's Included

This repository contains battle-tested architecture guides based on production experience:

### üèóÔ∏è Core Architecture Guides

- **[Domain-Driven Design](./domain-driven-design.md)** - Strategic and tactical DDD patterns and implementation
- **[CQRS & Event Sourcing](./cqrs-event-sourcing.md)** - Command Query Responsibility Segregation and event sourcing patterns
- **[API Design Patterns](./api-design-patterns.md)** - REST, GraphQL, and API versioning strategies
- **[Microservices Architecture](./microservices-architecture.md)** - Service decomposition and communication patterns
- **[System Design Principles](./system-design-principles.md)** - Scalable system architecture fundamentals
- **[Hexagonal Architecture](./hexagonal-architecture.md)** - Clean architecture and dependency inversion

## Who This Is For

- **Software Architects** - Designing scalable and maintainable systems
- **Senior Developers** - Understanding advanced architectural patterns
- **Technical Leaders** - Making architectural decisions
- **System Designers** - Creating robust system architectures
- **Teams** - Aligning on architectural standards and patterns

## Quick Start

1. **Assess Current Architecture**: Evaluate your existing system architecture
2. **Choose Patterns**: Select patterns that fit your domain and scale requirements
3. **Implement Incrementally**: Don't try to refactor everything at once
4. **Document Decisions**: Record architectural decisions and rationale

## Implementation Philosophy

These guides follow a **principles-first approach**:
- **Domain-Driven**: Start with understanding the business domain
- **Evolutionary**: Architecture evolves with business needs
- **Pragmatic**: Balance ideal patterns with practical constraints
- **Testable**: Architectures that enable comprehensive testing

## Key Topics Covered

### Domain-Driven Design
- Strategic design patterns (bounded contexts, context mapping)
- Tactical design patterns (entities, value objects, aggregates)
- Implementation strategies and real-world examples
- Event-driven architecture integration

### CQRS & Event Sourcing
- Command Query Responsibility Segregation patterns
- Event sourcing implementation strategies
- Projection patterns and read model optimization
- Consistency and concurrency handling

### API Design
- RESTful API design principles and patterns
- GraphQL schema design and optimization
- API versioning strategies and backward compatibility
- Authentication and authorization patterns

### Microservices
- Service decomposition strategies
- Inter-service communication patterns
- Data consistency in distributed systems
- Monitoring and observability in microservices
