# Code Review Guidelines

## Overview

Code reviews are essential for maintaining code quality, sharing knowledge, and ensuring consistency across our codebase. This guide establishes standards and best practices for both reviewers and authors.

## Code Review Philosophy

### Core Principles
1. **Constructive Feedback**: Focus on code, not the person
2. **Learning Opportunity**: Share knowledge and learn from others
3. **Quality Assurance**: Catch bugs and improve maintainability
4. **Consistency**: Ensure adherence to team standards
5. **Security**: Identify potential security vulnerabilities

### Review Goals
- **Correctness**: Does the code do what it's supposed to do?
- **Design**: Is the code well-designed for its purpose?
- **Functionality**: Does it work as intended for users?
- **Complexity**: Is it more complex than necessary?
- **Tests**: Are there appropriate tests?
- **Naming**: Are variables, functions, and classes well-named?
- **Comments**: Are comments clear and useful?
- **Documentation**: Is documentation updated?

## Review Comments

### Comment Types

#### Blocking Issues (Must Fix)
```
üö´ **BLOCKING**: This could cause a security vulnerability
```
- Security issues
- Breaking changes without migration
- Performance regressions
- Critical bugs

#### Suggestions (Should Fix)
```
üí° **SUGGESTION**: Consider using a Map instead of Object for better performance
```
- Code quality improvements
- Performance optimizations
- Better design patterns
- Maintainability improvements

#### Questions (Clarification)
```
‚ùì **QUESTION**: What happens if this API call fails?
```
- Understanding the approach
- Clarifying requirements
- Learning opportunities

#### Nitpicks (Optional)
```
üé® **NITPICK**: Consider renaming this variable for clarity
```
- Style preferences
- Minor improvements
- Non-critical suggestions

### Comment Examples

#### Good Comments
```markdown
üí° **SUGGESTION**: Consider extracting this logic into a separate function to improve readability and testability.

```javascript
// Instead of:
const processUserData = (users) => {
  // 50 lines of complex logic
}

// Consider:
const validateUsers = (users) => { /* validation logic */ }
const transformUsers = (users) => { /* transformation logic */ }
const processUserData = (users) => {
  const validUsers = validateUsers(users);
  return transformUsers(validUsers);
}
```

‚ùì **QUESTION**: How do we handle the case where the API returns a 429 (rate limited) response? Should we implement retry logic?

üö´ **BLOCKING**: This SQL query is vulnerable to injection attacks. Please use parameterized queries.
```

#### Poor Comments
```markdown
// Bad - Not constructive
This is wrong.

// Bad - Personal preference without explanation
I don't like this approach.

// Bad - Too vague
Can you improve this?
```

## Best Practices

### For Authors

#### Writing Reviewable Code
1. **Small PRs**: Keep PRs focused and under 400 lines when possible
2. **Atomic commits**: Each commit should represent a logical change
3. **Clear intent**: Make the purpose of changes obvious
4. **Test coverage**: Include appropriate tests
5. **Documentation**: Update docs for public APIs

#### Responding to Reviews
1. **Acknowledge feedback**: Respond to all comments
2. **Ask for clarification**: If feedback is unclear
3. **Explain decisions**: When you disagree with suggestions
4. **Mark resolved**: Mark comments as resolved when addressed
5. **Thank reviewers**: Appreciate the time spent reviewing

### For Reviewers

#### Effective Reviewing
1. **Understand context**: Read the PR description and related issues
2. **Check out code**: Test complex changes locally
3. **Focus on important issues**: Don't nitpick trivial matters
4. **Provide alternatives**: Suggest concrete improvements
5. **Recognize good work**: Acknowledge well-written code

#### Review Efficiency
1. **Review promptly**: Don't let PRs sit too long
2. **Batch comments**: Provide all feedback in one review cycle
3. **Use tools**: Leverage IDE and diff tools
4. **Focus areas**: Prioritize security, correctness, and design
5. **Approve when ready**: Don't delay approval for minor issues

## Tools and Automation

### Automated Checks
- **Linting**: ESLint, Pylint, Black
- **Type checking**: TypeScript, mypy
- **Security scanning**: CodeQL, Snyk
- **Test coverage**: Coverage reports
- **Performance**: Bundle analysis, load testing

### Review Tools
- **GitHub**: Pull request reviews with suggestions
- **IDE plugins**: Review code in your editor
- **CodeStream**: Real-time collaboration
- **SonarQube**: Code quality analysis

## Conflict Resolution

### Disagreements
1. **Discussion**: Have a respectful discussion
2. **Team input**: Involve other team members if needed
3. **Tech lead decision**: Escalate to technical leadership
4. **Documentation**: Document the decision for future reference

### Review Bottlenecks
1. **Multiple reviewers**: Don't wait for all reviewers
2. **Follow-up PRs**: Address non-blocking issues in follow-up
3. **Pair review**: Review together for complex changes
4. **Time limits**: Set reasonable time limits for reviews

## Metrics and Improvement

### Review Metrics
- **Review turnaround time**: Time from PR creation to merge
- **Number of review cycles**: How many back-and-forth rounds
- **Bug escape rate**: Bugs found in production that should have been caught
- **Review participation**: Ensure all team members participate

### Continuous Improvement
- **Retrospectives**: Discuss review process in team retrospectives
- **Training**: Provide training on effective code reviews
- **Tool updates**: Keep review tools up to date
- **Process refinement**: Regularly update these guidelines

## Examples

### Good PR Example
```markdown
## Fix user authentication timeout issue

### Problem
Users were being logged out after 30 minutes of inactivity, even when actively using the application.

### Solution
- Updated session management to reset timeout on user activity
- Added client-side activity detection
- Implemented proper token refresh mechanism

### Testing
- Added unit tests for session management
- Manual testing with different activity patterns
- Verified in staging environment

### Breaking Changes
None

### Screenshots
[Include screenshots of login flow]
```

### Good Review Example
```markdown
Overall looks good! The session management improvements are well thought out. A few suggestions:

üí° **SUGGESTION**: Consider debouncing the activity detection to avoid excessive API calls
- Line 45: The current implementation fires on every mouse move
- Could debounce to every 30 seconds to reduce server load

‚ùì **QUESTION**: What happens if the token refresh fails?
- Should we show a user-friendly message?
- How do we handle network errors during refresh?

üé® **NITPICK**: The function name `checkUserActivity` could be more descriptive
- Maybe `trackUserActivityForSession` or `updateSessionOnActivity`?

‚úÖ **APPROVED**: Great work on the comprehensive tests!
```

## Conclusion

Effective code reviews are a skill that improves with practice. Remember that the goal is to improve code quality while fostering a positive team culture. Focus on being constructive, thorough, and respectful in all interactions.
