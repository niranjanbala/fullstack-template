# Performance & Scaling Guides

**Part of the [Comprehensive Documentation Framework](https://github.com/niranjanbala/fullstack-template)**

A comprehensive collection of performance optimization and scaling strategies for modern software systems.

## What's Included

This repository contains battle-tested performance and scaling guides based on production experience:

### üöÄ Core Performance & Scaling Guides

- **[Auto-Scaling Patterns](./auto-scaling-patterns.md)** - Intelligent scaling strategies and implementation
- **[Database Performance Optimization](./database-performance-optimization.md)** - Query optimization and performance tuning
- **[CDN & Caching Strategies](./cdn-caching-strategies.md)** - Multi-layer caching and global distribution
- **[Performance Monitoring](./performance.md)** - Comprehensive monitoring and alerting strategies
- **[Scaling Strategies](./scaling-strategies.md)** - Horizontal and vertical scaling approaches
- **[Load Testing](./load-testing.md)** - Performance testing methodologies and tools

## Who This Is For

- **DevOps Engineers** - Implementing scalable infrastructure
- **Backend Developers** - Optimizing application performance
- **System Architects** - Designing scalable systems
- **SRE Teams** - Maintaining high-performance systems
- **CTO/Technical Leaders** - Making scaling decisions

## Quick Start

1. **Assess Current State**: Start with performance monitoring to understand your baseline
2. **Identify Bottlenecks**: Use the guides to identify performance issues
3. **Implement Solutions**: Follow the step-by-step optimization guides
4. **Monitor & Iterate**: Continuously monitor and improve performance

## Implementation Philosophy

These guides follow a **data-driven approach**:
- **Measure First**: Always measure before optimizing
- **Production-Tested**: All strategies have been proven in production
- **Scalable Solutions**: Patterns that work from thousands to millions of users
- **Cost-Effective**: Balance performance with infrastructure costs

## Key Topics Covered

### Auto-Scaling
- Horizontal vs Vertical scaling strategies
- Predictive scaling algorithms
- Container orchestration with Kubernetes
- Cloud provider auto-scaling (AWS, Azure, GCP)

### Database Performance
- Query optimization techniques
- Index strategies and performance
- Connection pooling and management
- Database sharding and partitioning

### Caching Strategies
- Multi-layer caching architecture
- CDN optimization and configuration
- Cache invalidation patterns
- Global distribution strategies

### Performance Monitoring
- Real-time performance metrics
- Application performance monitoring (APM)
- Infrastructure monitoring
- Alert configuration and management
