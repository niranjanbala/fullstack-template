# Architecture Decision Framework - Standalone Products vs Core Platform

## üéØ **DECISION FRAMEWORK OVERVIEW**

### **Core Principle**
When building non-core platform features, we must decide between:
1. **Internal Development** - Built as standalone products that can eventually move out of the codebase
2. **Core Platform Integration** - Built directly into the learner10x.com platform

### **Decision Criteria**
- **Business Value**: Can this become a standalone product/service?
- **Market Potential**: Is there a market for this as a separate product?
- **Technical Complexity**: Does it warrant its own codebase?
- **Reusability**: Can other platforms/companies use this?
- **Maintenance Overhead**: Does it need separate maintenance cycles?
