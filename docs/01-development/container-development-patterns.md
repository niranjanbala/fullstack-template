## Container Development Philosophy

### Core Principles
- **Consistency**: Same environment across development, testing, and production
- **Isolation**: Each service runs in its own container with minimal dependencies
- **Portability**: Containers run anywhere Docker is supported
- **Scalability**: Easy horizontal scaling and load distribution
- **Maintainability**: Clear container boundaries and responsibilities

### Container-First Development
- **Design for containers**: Applications built with containerization in mind
- **Stateless design**: Containers should be stateless and ephemeral
- **Configuration externalization**: Environment-specific config outside containers
- **Health checks**: Built-in health monitoring and self-healing
- **Graceful shutdown**: Proper signal handling and cleanup

## Development Container Patterns

### Pattern 1: Development Container with Hot Reload

- Set up development-specific environment variables

**Best Practices**:
- Use separate Dockerfile for development
- Include development dependencies
- Configure appropriate file watching
- Set up proper logging for debugging

### Pattern 2: Database Development Container
