## Microservices Philosophy

### Core Principles
- **Single Responsibility**: Each service owns a specific business capability
- **Decentralized**: Independent deployment and scaling
- **Fault Isolation**: Failure in one service doesn't cascade
- **Technology Diversity**: Choose the right tool for each service
- **Evolutionary Design**: Services can evolve independently

### When to Use Microservices
**Good Candidates**:
- Large, complex applications
- Multiple teams working on different features
- Need for independent scaling
- Technology diversity requirements
- Organizational autonomy needs

**Consider Alternatives When**:
- Small applications or teams
- Simple, well-defined domains
- Strong consistency requirements
- Limited operational maturity
- Tight coupling between components

### Microservices vs. Monoliths
**Microservices Benefits**:
- Independent deployment
- Technology diversity
- Fault isolation

**Monolith Benefits**:
- Simpler development
- Easier testing
- Simpler deployment
- Better performance
- ACID transactions

## Service Design Patterns

### Domain-Driven Design
