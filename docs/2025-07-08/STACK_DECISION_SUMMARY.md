## 🚨 **RISK MITIGATION**

### **High-Risk Items**
1. **Elasticsearch Complexity**
   - **Mitigation**: Start with PostgreSQL FTS, migrate to Elasticsearch later
   - **Fallback**: Use Algolia if Elasticsearch proves too complex

2. **Real-time Features**
   - **Mitigation**: Begin with simple polling, add WebSockets gradually
   - **Fallback**: Use Pusher service if Socket.io becomes complex

3. **Database Scaling**
   - **Mitigation**: Plan for read replicas from day one
   - **Fallback**: Use managed database services

### **Medium-Risk Items**
1. **Authentication Complexity**
   - **Mitigation**: Start with basic auth, add social login later
   - **Fallback**: Use Auth0 if NextAuth.js becomes complex

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - **Mitigation**: Monitor performance from day one
   - **Fallback**: Use Vercel's built-in optimizations
